# OniScan
A very simple TOR Hidden Service Web scanner & page scraper written in C#.
The only current function is PHPMyAdmin scanner, which tries to access any possible open PHPMyAdmin directories.

What's the goal of all this you might ask ?
This whole project is only a 'base' that can easily be extended. My main goal was to make C# work with TOR successfully.
I can imagine many other useful scanning features being added in the future.
